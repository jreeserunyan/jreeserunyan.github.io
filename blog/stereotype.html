            <h2>Stereotypes and Impostors</h2>
            <h5>“The single story creates stereotypes, and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete. They make one story become the only story.”<br>
            ― Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie </h5>
    <article>
        <h4>Sept 27, 2015</h4>
        <p>While I had never heard the term stereotype threat until recently, I can certainly look around and see it cringing in the shadows. The term, as covered by Claude M. Steele is new to me, but not the meaning behind it. Basically, we all have identities, based on a huge variety of characteristics including age, sex, religious affiliation, race, and social class, to name a few.</p>
        <p>And that’s fine. Our identities are often comforting.<br> What makes an identity become important, and <em>problematic</em>, for an individual is <em>dealing</em> with it. I find this subject heartbreaking...</p>

        <p>I am a middle class white girl from the suburbs who likes the arts and literature. I often fit in the places I want to go. Which are also the places I was encouraged to go, because I was a middle class white girl from the suburbs.</p>
        <p>Until I decided to learn about programming. And I don’t mean from just DBC, or really DBC at all. I mean that it exists and I hate how true this is. I hate the stereotype and I hate that it’s mere existence can change me. But I know it does.</p>

        <p>As a white girl, I am completely aware of all the privileges I have. This discussion really invoked Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie in her novel <em>Americanah</em>. If you've never thought about stereotype threat, or think about it all the time, I suggest reading this amazing (and genuinely accessible) book, to explore how identity is deeply situational.</p>

        <p>I also have guilt about the fact that some stereotypes work in my favor. It’s crap, but I would be a liar if I said that I have never noticed my advantages.</p>
        <p>One of the interesting things Steele mentions to combat stereotype threat is very simple: phrase expectations in ways that are more welcoming. What really gets me about this is my own experience with standardized testing. As a child, I was a bit high-strung and could make life harder for myself than necessary. Before my first experience with standardized testing, my mom, who was a very good teacher, told me something.</p>
        <p><em>“There is a cultural bias in standardized testing, but it’s in your favor, so you will do fine."</em></p>
        <p>And I did. I was often very bored during testing, but not nervous. Never nervous. And my test scores were very good! I remember hating that there was a cultural bias, even if it was in my favor. And I know what I really took from it was that standardized testing was basically meaningless.</p>

        <p>So, <b>guilt</b> makes me extra-anxious when I come across the contingency cues discussed by Steele. Why? A popular suggestion is impostor syndrome.</p>
        <p>"<em><b>Impostor syndrome</b> is a psychological phenomenon in which people are unable to internalize their accomplishments. Despite external evidence of their competence, those with the syndrome remain convinced that they are frauds and do not deserve the success they have achieved. Proof of success is dismissed as luck, timing, or as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are more intelligent and competent than they believe themselves to be. Notably, impostor syndrome is particularly common among high-achieving women."</em> <br>
        - Taken directly from <em>wikipedia</em>, to be updated if I ever have time.</p>
        <p>And yes, this annoying, reductive cousin of stereotype threat is much more a part of my life. This is where I fear I will fail myself, my gender and my world.</p> 
        <h5>Thanks for reading this cultural discussion, if I got something wrong, or if you have something to add, please let me know!!</h5>
