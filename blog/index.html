    	<p>Version control is beneficial because it keeps things tidy. Especailly with open source projects, where there are endless versions of things, developers would be lost without a good version control system.</p>
    	<p>Git allows you to create commits, which wraps up a set of changes you have made and asks you to leave a note that will help give context to any user who looks at it.</p>
    	<p>GitHub is a great place to store code because it's efficient and practical. It also makes it possible to access the code from anywhere and share it with everyone.</p>
    	<p>I have more to say but no time to say it, so really quick: Git is local. Github is remote (on the web). The analogy of Git is to Github as a flash drive is to to dropbox is useful. But it’s not magic. You have to tell git to get things from GitHub and vice-versa.</p>
