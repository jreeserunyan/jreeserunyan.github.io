      DBC can only give you what you put into it. It’s important not to look at the experience as a prepackaged deal. Every cohort evolves differently. So if you are going to be involved in that evolution, you need to participate.  Don’t deny your cohort your voice.

DBC seems like an open, supportive community that believes in throwing babies into rivers to teach them to swim. It’s only just started and I am drowning a little bit. But that is what I expected. If I can keep my head above water a bit longer, I think I’ll start to really enjoy rising to the challenge. Excited and nervous in equal measures.

 <p> But it all keeps bringing me back to the song Goldmine by BREANNE DUREN.  "I've been searching for a gold mine to open up the skies and make me feel alive
Been searching for a gold mine / Well I've been traveling high and low, I'm searching for that glow before it strays. I only got one life to give
Only have so long to live. Won't throw this away."
