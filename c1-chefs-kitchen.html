      DBC can only give you what you put into it. It’s important not to look at the experience as a prepackaged deal. Every cohort evolves differently. So if you are going to be involved in that evolution, you need to participate.  Don’t deny your cohort your voice.
    </p>
    <p>
DBC seems like an open, supportive community that believes in throwing babies into rivers to teach them to swim. It’s only just started and I am drowning a little bit. But that is what I expected. If I can keep my head above water a bit longer, I think I’ll start to really enjoy rising to the challenge. Excited and nervous in equal measures.

 <p> But it all keeps bringing me back to the song Goldmine by BREANNE DUREN.  "I've been searching for a gold mine to open up the skies and make me feel alive. Been searching for a gold mine. Well I've been traveling high and low, I'm searching for that glow before it strays. I only got one life to give
Only have so long to live. Won't throw this away."
