#3.5 Your Website, part 3; REFLECTION

####What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
Padding is the area between the content and the border. The border is the line between the padding and the margin. The margin is the space between the border and the edge of the page. I setup a “debug” border that outlines designated areas in red. I loved how it showed me my defined areas, it was incredibly helpful.

####What did you learn about CSS positioning?
Part of what I learned is that I still don’t fully understand these perfectly, because at times when I would make a change, the result was completely different than what I expected. Also positioning seems really reliant on floats to work perfectly. 

####What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
The fonts were very easy. Adding the aside went well too, and that was part I had worried about. I had to add more to the html to make the CSS work than I expected. It took me a little while to get an image and text to be on top of a background image in the header. Overall, I think I have some redundant CSS and I am looking forward to learning how to clean it up.

####What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
Make clear sections. Keep things flexible. Try to follow some basic naming conventions. I learned that it’s really useful to be able to have multiple stylesheets, but it’s important to think about where you are adding the info and the cascade order.

Oh, and I learned the names of the different parts of a declaration block `selector { ruleset }` then ruleset is made up of `{ property: value; }` so that I could refer to them if I needed to. Also, it's a good idea to keep your rulesets in alphabetical order.
